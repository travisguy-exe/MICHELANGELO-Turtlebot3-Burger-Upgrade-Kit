## 3D Printing/Post Processing Instructions



The MICHELANGELO upgrade kit requires **1** print of each part contained within this sub folder. The parts have been designed to be easily printable on any FDM type printer. 

**NOTE:** This folder contains Raspberry Pi enclosure variants for both the **Raspberry Pi 3B+** and the newer **Raspberry Pi 4**. Print the case relevant to your version of the Turtlebot3 Burger.

Once printed, several holes on Parts No. **01**, **02**, and **04** require **tapping**. An **M3-0.5** tap is required for this process. The **RED** circles in the image below indicate the relevant holes that require tapping on each part.
